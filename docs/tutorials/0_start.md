# Introduction 

This section provides tutorials that are geared towards people completely unfamiliar with `fmdt`. Every tutorial will require having downloaded `fmdt-python` and the executables `fmdt-detect` and `fmdt-visu` first so if you haven't completed those steps, head on over to [Installation](../installation.md).
